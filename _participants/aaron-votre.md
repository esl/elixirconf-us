Aaron has been a professional engineer for over 10 years and has been using Elixir professionally for the last 8. As the second engineer at his last company, he helped grow the team to 40 developers and build a successful product acquired by Travelers Insurance in 2024. Now, at his second Elixir-based startup, he's continuing to develop with Phoenix, going all in on LiveView (previously an ELM SPA with some LiveView). Notably, diving into Event Sourcing and the Commanded community after seeing how big of a positive impact it could've had in his last role. Aaron previously spoke at ElixirConf in 2018 about GraphQL with Absinthe, and he's excited to return with hard-earned lessons and a real-world perspective.

Aaron got married in 2024 and lives with his wife and two big dogs, Jackson and Fenrir, in the Great Boston Area.

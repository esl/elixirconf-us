I am very passionate about using and teaching Elixir and have been doing so for the last 7 years.

I am a member of the Elixir Language Server team, the leader and author of the elixir-tools family of developer tools, the maintainer of Wallaby, and the author of Temple.

I currently work at DraftKings as a Lead Software Engineer.

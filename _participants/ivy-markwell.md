Ivy is a software engineer based in Austin, Texas who’s been coding for 10 years and writing Elixir for the last 7. She works at Vetspire, a company that helps veterinarians — which is a perfect fit since she loves animals and fosters kittens in her spare time. When she’s not working you can probably find her outside on a run or playing video games.

Enjoying programming full stack for 15 years and counting. Open Source enthusiast. Author and maintainer of Tower, Blend and Candlex Elixir libraries. I believe that digging deep into problems and understanding how things work pays off most of the time, both in terms of helping one learn and coming up with a good solution, or even the sometimes underrated we-should-not-do-anything solution. Proud father. Sports watcher and player.

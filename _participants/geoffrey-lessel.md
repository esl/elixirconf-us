Geoffrey (“Geo”) has been breaking computers since he tinkered around on his family’s 286 in the 1980s. He’s developed software professionally in many languages over the years (PHP, Perl, Javascript, Ruby, Elixir) but Elixir is his favorite by far. By day, he’s a principal developer at Symbolic.ai marrying Elixir and AI. By night, he likes to dabble in various hobbies including sim racing, modular synthesizers, embedded hardware, music, and hanging out with his family. If there’s something new to learn, he’s probably interested!

On top of that he's the author of Phoenix in Action (published by Manning Publications), released Build It With Phoenix (a video course on Elixir and Phoenix at https://builditwithphoenix.com), and a speaker at many conferences (including 4 previous ElixirConfs and a Lonestar ElixirConf).

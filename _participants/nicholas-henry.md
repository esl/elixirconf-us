Residing in the vibrant city of Montreal, Canada, Nicholas embodies the dual spirit of a business analyst and a seasoned software developer. He co-founded the Montreal Elixir meetup, led a specialized Elixir development studio, and has a profound enthusiasm for business modeling that complements his coding expertise.

Nicholas is deeply passionate about mentoring developers and is committed to accelerating their professional growth and guiding them through all aspects of the software development life cycle.

Nicholas actively tries to put all of his life into source control and reorganizes his bookmarks on a Friday night (only a couple of times a year, though).

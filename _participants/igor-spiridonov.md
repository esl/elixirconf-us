I’m a software engineer turned Tech Lead with over 7 years of industry experience, including the last 3 years specializing in Elixir. I currently work at coneva GmbH, where I drove the adoption of Elixir across our platform. Before joining coneva, I worked on a B2B car auction platform, also built with Elixir, helping to shape the architecture during a critical growth phase. Before moving into the startup world, I was a lead Java developer, leading the development of a major project for the BMW Group, where I focused on delivering scalable enterprise solutions. I’m passionate about building systems that are simple, resilient, and enjoyable for developers to work with.

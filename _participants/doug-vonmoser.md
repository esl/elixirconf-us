Doug is a Software Engineer at Cars.com, where he has been developing and contributing for the past nine years. He began his software development career after graduating from a coding boot camp, initially diving deep into the worlds of JavaScript and Node.js. His transition into the Elixir ecosystem sparked a fascination with how frameworks like Phoenix and Ecto can implicitly guide developers toward robust design principles and best practicesâ€”an insight that inspired the topic of his talk.

Outside of his professional life, Doug is a husband and father of three active boys. In his spare time, you might find him modifying their Power Wheels for extra fun or occasionally embracing the invigorating shock of a cold plunge.

Juan started his web development journey as a Ruby on Rails more than 15 years ago when the web was much simpler.

In 2016 he founded Mimiquate and tried Elixir for the first time and transitioned to the Elixir & Phoenix stack, building and deploying apps to his customers.

He considers himself a true full-stack developer, working fluently on the backend and the frontend.

A veteran software craftsman with 25 years of building digital solutions, I'm passionate about open-source contributions and elegant code architecture. Beyond the keyboard, I find balance through the disciplined art of aikido and the creative exploration of culinary adventures. My journey spans from low-level systems to modern web frameworks, always seeking to blend technical excellence with practical solutions.

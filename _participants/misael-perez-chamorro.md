Misael Pérez Chamorro is a software architect with over 18 years of experience designing and building distributed systems, mobile apps, and backend platforms across Elixir, Erlang, Go, and Ruby. He currently leads development at Tich, an Elixir-powered virtual classroom platform focused on real-time collaboration and media streaming.

He’s the former host of the virtual Elixir Meetup in Mexico and a passionate advocate for using OTP to solve real-world coordination and scalability problems. When he’s not coding, you’ll probably find him on a bike ride or exploring open-world video games. Misael enjoys systems that are clean, resilient, and fun to build — which is why he keeps coming back to the BEAM.

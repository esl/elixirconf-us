As the Chief Information Security Officer at the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation (EEF), I drive security initiatives across Erlang, Elixir, Gleam, and the broader community. My role involves analyzing and implementing data protection, compliance, and secure development practices—particularly focusing on requirements like EU CRA/CISA and supply chain integrity. I maintain the EEF’s CNA (CVE Numbering Authority), ensuring vulnerability disclosures are managed effectively. I also collaborate closely with volunteer working groups, design software solutions for security challenges, and actively engage in fundraising activities.

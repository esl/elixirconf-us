I’m a product-focused developer working at Jump, where we’re using LLMs to help financial advisors do less tedious stuff and more of the work they love. Formerly at Felt (the “Figma for maps”), I’ve worked in a number of soft real-time, distributed systems domains, including networking, video streaming, and IOT command-and-control systems. I fell in love with Elixir in 2019, when I used it to build a massively multiplayer game server for the X-Plane flight simulator, and I’ve been working primarily with Elixir ever since.

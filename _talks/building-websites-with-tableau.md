Tableau is a new static site generator for Elixir!

In the spirit of going all in on Elixir tooling, I built Tableau to create the website for elixir-tools and Next LS. Since then, myself and others have migrated their blogs to Tableau as well as built whole new sites!

Tableau makes it easy to create website that can be hosted on providers like Netlify, GitHub Pages, or even an S3 bucket, while getting to use the template engine you love (HEEx, Temple, Liquid) and all of your favorite Elixir packages (Req, ESBuild, Tailwind).

Let's dive into Tableau and have some fun!

I will explore the potential of Elixir in developing AI agents, challenging the predominant Python-centric approach. 
The talk will explore why Elixir's architectural and language features make it an ideal choice for AI agent development.

Key Discussion Points
1. Foundational Architectural Considerations
    * Analyzing the core components of AI agents: state management, concurrency, and decision-making processes
    * The current best practices in architecting AI Agents
    * Examining how Elixir's BEAM VM, OTP, and functional programming paradigm fit the problem perfectly 
2. Technical Implementation Strategies
    * Detailed exploration of GenServer for state management in AI agents
    * Architectural patterns for building multi-agent systems using OTP
    * Mechanisms for integrating external AI and machine learning services
    * Leveraging Elixir's concurrency model and fault-tolerance capabilities
3. What the Elixir ecosystem needs to do to be the no-brainer choice in Agent development

**Key Takeaways:**

- Why AI Agents don't require python packages
- How to build AI Agents in elixir
- Best practices in AI Agents
- What the Elixir ecosystem needs to excel in Agent development

**Target Audience:**

- Elixir developers interested in LLMs.
- Non-elixir devs curious about how Elixir can be an excellent choice for AI projects.

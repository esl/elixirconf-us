In today's Elixir ecosystem, dependencies are often the default solution. This session challenges that paradigm, showcasing the surprising capabilities of the Erlang/OTP standard library. We'll dive into building production-ready components without relying on external packages, demonstrating practical, real-world applications.
Network Mastery: Direct TCP, HTTP, and SSH: Implement high-performance network services and secure communication directly with gen_tcp, httpd, and ssh.
Data Without ORMs: Direct Database and Custom Storage: Explore efficient data handling strategies using Erlang's database drivers and alternative storage solutions, bypassing the overhead of ORMs.
Simplified Deployment: mix release for Lean Deployments: Streamline your deployment process with mix release, creating self-contained, easily deployable applications.
Real-World Scenarios and Performance Benefits: Analyze practical use cases where standard library solutions excel, highlighting the performance and security advantages of minimal dependencies.
When and Why to Embrace the Core: Establish clear guidelines for when to leverage the standard library and when external dependencies are truly necessary.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Challenge the dependency-heavy norm! This talk explores the surprising power of Elixir's standard library, demonstrating how to build robust applications without external packages. Attendees will gain actionable insights and practical techniques for building robust, efficient, and secure Elixir applications, leveraging the power of the core language and minimizing dependency bloat.

**Target Audience:**

- This talk is intended for everyone. By focusing on core elixir, these techniques, the approach described in this talk can be used by anyone in any elixir runtime. Dependency-free elixir will help make you a more competent and confident engineer.

There are many tools to mock in Elixir. Which should we use? 

Mox, the blessed one? Or meck, the one that started it all? Or maybe you lean towards it's spiritual successor, Mock? Or better yet, you like to Mimic? 

Or... I know, you're one of those punk-rock devs who likes to use protocols and mock with Promox or Protomock. Or maybe you're just too hardcore for libraries, and you like to roll your own. Ah, I got it, you're one of those "don't mock me, bro" people.  

Whichever camp you're in (and trust me, I've been in a few of those), when was the last time you evaluated your approach? ðŸ¤”

Don't worry, you don't have to do all that homework. That's what I've done -- and I'm here to show you the results. 

Let's sit down, compare and contrast them, talk a little about how they work, and come up with a rubric for when you should choose one over another. 

So join me, and you'll never again have to wonder if you're mocking the code or if the code is mocking you.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Evaluate and learn which mocking techniques to use in Elixir

**Target Audience:**

- People who are daunted by mocking in Elixir (or who just want a refresher in mocking)

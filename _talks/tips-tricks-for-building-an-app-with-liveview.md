Over the last few years I have learned various tips and tricks to build fun and interactive apps using LiveView. 

During my talk I will explore three main areas:
- Optimizations I have found to improve the user experience, for example by reducing diff sizes.
- A library I built called live_sync (available on Hex), this was inspired by Jose's talk last year and utilizes postgres replication to update LiveViews.
- Utilizing hooks, webcomponents, and javascript to enhance the frontend experience

**Key Takeaways:**

- Gain ideas for fun things to build in LiveView and possible ways to achieve them

**Target Audience:**

- Anyone working with LiveView or who wants to work with it

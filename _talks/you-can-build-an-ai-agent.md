AI agents are all the rage these days, but they can be a bit intimidating if you haven't tried building one yet. I'll explain what agents really are at a high level, discuss why Elixir is the perfect language for building them, and demonstrate how to build a basic AI receptionist and other agentic AI features for an application.

**Key Takeaways:**

- AI agents aren't as formidable as they seem. You'll leave this talk feeling both confident that you could build an agent, but also excited to do so.

**Target Audience:**

- This should appeal to developers who haven't built an AI agent before, whether that's because they're intimidated, or because they don't know where to start.

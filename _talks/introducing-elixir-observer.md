The talk covers the journey from inception to production of the Elixir Observer, a tool built to help newcomers to the ecosystem easily find and discover what the ecosystem has to offer.

Besides the technical challenges, Elixir Observer was built with a strong focus on its design, making it appealing to developers outside our community. 

The presentation will also cover what's in the roadmap for the tool's future, and how can any member of our community can contribute to its development.

**Key Takeaways:**

- The main takeaway of my presentation is encouraging other community members to contribute to any opportunity they see to help with Elixir's adoption.

- A secondary takeaway is for attendees to challenge the tools our community uses and think on how to improve them.

**Target Audience:**

- The target audience can be divided into two:
- Newcomers or beginners who don't know how to discover what's available in the ecosystem
- Experienced community members who can help improve the community tools

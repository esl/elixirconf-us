This panel brings together voices from across the Elixir community to share their journeys: how they entered tech, the milestones that shaped their careers, the lessons they’ve learned along the way, and the ways they navigate the balance between building software and building a life. Whether you’re just starting out or years into your career, you’ll hear stories that connect across experience levels, with insights on community, collaboration, and the evolving role of Elixir in the wider tech landscape. Join the talk with Allison Randall, Anna Sherman, Lorena Mireles, and Savannah Manning.

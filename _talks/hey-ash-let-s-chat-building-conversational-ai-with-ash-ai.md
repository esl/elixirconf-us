Conversational AI interfaces are rapidly emerging as a core part of modern applications, enhancing user experience through natural, dynamic interactions. Ash, as a powerful declarative framework, is uniquely suited for building such interfaces—so the arrival of Ash AI feels like a natural evolution.

In this session, I’ll share my experience integrating an AI-powered conversational interface into a real-world SaaS product using Ash AI. I’ll briefly introduce key Ash concepts, then show how Ash AI builds on them to streamline the creation of conversational UIs. Through practical examples, we’ll explore how to implement an intelligent chat interface with minimal code, and discuss real considerations when designing and building such systems.

**Key Takeaways:**

- A clear understanding of Ash’s declarative approach—and why it provides an ideal foundation for building intelligent, conversational interfaces.
- Practical insights into how AI operate using tools (i.e., application functions), and how these can be seamlessly integrated into Elixir applications.
- A hands-on look at how Ash AI connects Ash resources to conversational AI through simple, expressive declarations.
- Lessons learned from real-world challenges when building AI-powered chat interfaces—and strategies to navigate them effectively.

**Target Audience:**

- This session is ideal for Elixir developers interested in building AI-powered experiences, particularly those exploring Ash or declarative design patterns. It is designed to be accessible not only to developers already familiar with Ash, but also to those encountering it for the first time.

- The speaker previously gave an Ash-focused talk at liftIO 2024 in Korea, where the audience included many who were new—even to Elixir. The session was voted best of the conference, praised for its clarity, approachability, and ability to explain complex concepts.

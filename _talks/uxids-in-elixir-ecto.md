I want to present a unique way of doing UXIDs in elixir that is really easy to set up. When using UXIDs in elixir, a lot of things get much cleaner. You can:
- Auto link ids in a liveview admin app
- Automatically & universally figure out permissions (can this user see this id)
- Map ids to schemas by prefix
- Pattern match ids by prefix

I'd love to show people how easy they are to set up and use and then then the many advantages.

**Key Takeaways:**

- They should try using UXIDs
- It's easy
- There are a lot of advantages and it makes a lot of things easier

**Target Audience:**

- Web developers

Being an Elixir champion in challenging times requires more than better programming or system design. It demands that we each take on some responsibility for community growth and ecosystem promotion. The world beyond our borders, those unaware of OTP and unversed in the power of our languages, need to be tempted by prospect of our elegant, economical, and durable solutions. Only through collective action as a community can we broadly seed these ideas to foster acceptance and adoption. This session will provide context, a road map, and actions any member can take to realize these goals and ensure a strong and growing Elixir.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Areas of need within the ecosystem and objective audiences in need of connection. A selection of actions individuals can take to engage and deepen connections within the community, and to build resources and capacity for outreach. Approaches and materials needed and available to help members conduct outreach to a variety of audiences.

**Target Audience:**

- People interested in the sustainability and growth of the ecosystem and community, and greater acceptance of Elixir by prospective employers and customers.

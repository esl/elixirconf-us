The WebAssembly Component model makes it much more practical to use WebAssembly for real world use cases. Now that support for the component model has landed in wasmex, we are able host and call WASM components from our Elixir applications. This makes it possible to host and execute code written in a wide variety of languages in a secure, sandboxed environment and interact with it using idiomatic Elixir. Would you like to allow users to customize your Elixir SAAS platform with user provided Python? Have you ever wanted to write a LiveView in Golang? The possibilities are only as limited as our imagination. In this session, we will introduce the wasm component model and see what it gives us. We’ll explore the wasmex library and how it integrates wasm components in Elixir. We’ll do it all with concrete code examples so you can see how everything works.

**Key Takeaways:**

- The users will understand
- wasm component model
- improvements vs core wasm
- how to host and call them from elixir
- where and when they are useful

**Target Audience:**

- Elixir developers who are at least WASM curious, especially those who ran away when they saw how tedious and low-level building anything with WebAssembly used to be :)

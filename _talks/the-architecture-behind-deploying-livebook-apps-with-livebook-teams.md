In this talk, we’ll explore the architecture that powers the seamless deployment of Livebook apps with just a click of a button. This system combines a hybrid approach with an app running on localhost, a SaaS layer, and an on-premises app. We’ll examine how these distributed system components interact, the challenges they address, and how Elixir’s OTP is leveraged to make it all work.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Learn how Livebook internals leverage Elixir, OTP, and Phoenix.

**Target Audience:**

- Developers who already have experience with Elixir and Phoenix.

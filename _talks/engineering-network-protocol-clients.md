This talk explores the development of Elixir-powered tools for working with a Blockchain node. We'll go through the journey of implementing both a WebSocket and custom binary protocol, discussing challenges encountered and how OTP's architecture provided elegant solutions. You'll leave with practical knowledge of how Elixir's fault-tolerance and concurrency model can be applied to complex external system integration.

**Key Takeaways:**

- How to leverage Elixir's concurrency model and OTP for building network applications. Practical implementation patterns for building WebSocket and binary protocol clients in Elixir - in particular using the gen_statem behaviour.

**Target Audience:**

- Intermediate Elixir developers interested in network programming techniques and learning more about state machines using gen_statem

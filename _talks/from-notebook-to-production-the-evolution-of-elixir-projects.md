Ever wondered how an Elixir project evolves from a simple experiment to a full-scale production application? This talk takes you on a journey through the Elixir ecosystem's tooling layers, demonstrating how each level serves different needs while maintaining the language's core principles. We'll explore the seamless progression from Livebook prototypes to scripts, standalone libraries, and finally, a complete Phoenix application.
In this practical session, we'll follow the natural evolution of an Elixir project through four distinct layers of tooling:

Livebook:  rapid prototyping and interactive development, showing how Livebook serves as an excellent entry point for experimentation and documentation.
Scripts: Moving to standalone scripts, we'll demonstrate how to transform Livebook experiments into reusable CLI tools, introducing proper error handling and configuration.
Library tools: We'll explore the transition to structured libraries, covering Mix project organization, Oban,etc
Phoenix Applications: Finally, we'll scale up to a full Phoenix application, showcasing how previous components can be integrated while leveraging Phoenix's powerful features.

**Key Takeaways:**

- When to use each tooling layer effectively
- How to maintain code quality across different contexts
- Strategies for graduating code between layers
- Best practices for testing at each level

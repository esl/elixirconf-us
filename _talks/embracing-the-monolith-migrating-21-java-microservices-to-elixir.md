One year ago, our architecture consisted of 21 Java microservices, designed for scalability but increasingly costly to maintain. We faced complexity, slow iteration, and an overwhelmed team. In search of simplicity and agility, we chose Elixir and embarked on an unconventional path: consolidating into a monolithic architecture.

In this talk, I’ll share our journey, starting from the moment we realized our microservices had become our bottleneck. I’ll show you how Elixir’s unique strengths made a monolithic approach not only feasible but advantageous.

By the end, you’ll understand the practicalities of moving from microservices back to a monolith, recognize scenarios where this approach makes sense, and see how Elixir specifically empowers monolithic architectures.

Join me to discover why sometimes the simplest solution is also the most effective.

**Key Takeaways:**

- How Elixir uniquely supports scalable monolithic applications.
- Strategies and pitfalls when migrating to Elixir.
- Concrete lessons we learned from dismantling our microservices architecture.

**Target Audience:**

- Developers who are curious about Elixir’s distinctive capabilities that uniquely support building maintainable monolithic applications without sacrificing scalability or performance.

- Architects, Technical Leads and Decision-makers seeking insights into architectural strategies that improve maintainability, agility, and team productivity.

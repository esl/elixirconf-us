Ready to accelerate your journey from early career or mid-level to senior engineer? Are you new to testing or unsure where to start? This session will show you how mastering testing in Elixir is the key to unlocking your next level, and is a key for designing better code. 

We'll show how writing tests first can help you imagine ideal interfaces, clarify requirements, and guide you toward robust, maintainable solutions like a true senior engineer. 

Through practical examples and live demos, you’ll discover how a test-driven mindset empowers you to think ahead, communicate intent, and deliver code that stands out. 

Whether you’re just starting out or looking to break through to the next tier, this talk will equip you with actionable strategies to make testing your secret weapon for career growth.

**Key Takeaways:**

- This talk aims teach early and mid career engineers what matters when testing, how to use tests to help design code that will be maintainable and make sense both to them, and to a larger team, and how it can help them avoid costly mistake or rework by using tests to surface a lack of clarity in business requirements.

**Target Audience:**

- This is focused on early and mid career engineers that are looking to level up quickly and set themselves apart from other engineers at this point in their career.

Everything changes. Technology changes, people change, projects change, organizations and companies change, countries change, planets change, galaxies change...everything changes. Resilience is the ability to adapt to change, the persistence to endure change, the strength to survive change, and the resourcefulness to thrive beyond change. But, resilience isn't simply an innate quality that you either have or you don't, it's a skill that you learn and improve over time, and a strategy that you apply in every decision, every day. The massive change we've seen over the past 50 years of open source (and software in general) isn't unique or surprising, and the next 50 years are sure to be equally interesting. We can learn a lot by observing how open source has (and hasn't) been resilient in the past and analyzing the qualities that make open source resilient. And, with a little work and planning we can apply those lessons to build resilience in our own projects and communities, and help navigate our shared future of continuous change.

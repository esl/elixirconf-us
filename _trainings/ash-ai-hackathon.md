Join us for an introduction to Ash AI followed by a free-form hackathon on AI apps with Ash. This session is open to all levelsâ€”whether you're just starting out or already experienced. The trainer will be available throughout to support participants with questions ranging from beginner to advanced. If you're new to Ash, we recommend attending one of the earlier Ash trainings to get the most out of the hackathon.

Learn how to write an e-ink display driver using Elixir and Nerves. In this workshop, weâ€™ll provide some custom, Nerves capable hardware with an attached e-ink display which you can take home afterwards. Using this hardware, we will go through the process of drawing images to the screen. This covers essential skills like reading a datasheet and understanding the fundamentals of hardware communication protocols like SPI. No prior Nerves experience necessary!

**DURATION**

3 hours

**Workshop objectives:**
The goal of the workshop is to expose developers more experienced in Phoenix and server programming to hardware via Nerves. We would cover the getting started with Nerves - how to build a firmware, how to flash a board, how to build a driver for a sensor.

**Workshop prerequisites:**
It would be best if the attendees were to follow the installation instructions for Nerves before arriving. This workshop requires additional hardware, which participants will need to purchase separately (estimated cost: approx. $50). Details on how to obtain the hardware will be provided before the event.

Ash comes with powerful, out-of-the-box multi-tenancy support — and in this hands-on workshop, you’ll harness that magic to build a multi-tenant application from the ground up. We'll explore different approaches to multi-tenancy, integrate with AshAuthentication, and highlight best practices along the way. By the end, you’ll have a solid foundation to build and scale multi-tenant apps with confidence — and the reassurance that Ash has your back.

**Workshop objectives:**
By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

1. Understand the core concepts of multi-tenancy and the different strategies for implementing it in Elixir applications using Ash.
2. Build a multi-tenant application from scratch leveraging Ash’s built-in support.
3. Integrate AshAuthentication into a multi-tenant setup to manage users across tenants securely.
4. Evaluate trade-offs between different multi-tenancy models, such as shared vs isolated databases.
5. Apply best practices for scalability and maintainability in multi-tenant Ash applications.
6. Gain confidence to extend and customize multi-tenancy solutions in their own projects using Ash's ecosystem.

**Training prerequisites:**
* Basic familiarity with Elixir (no need to be an expert — comfort with the syntax and concepts is enough).
* Some experience with Ash Framework is helpful but not required — we’ll walk through everything step by step.

Required Software
* Elixir (v1.15 or later)
* Erlang/OTP (compatible with your Elixir version)
* PostgreSQL
* Git

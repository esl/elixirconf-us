---
Crash course on using Ash Framework covering major Ash concepts with real world examples. You will get a fully working Github repo to deep dive during and after the workshop.

**DURATION**

3 hours

**Workshop objectives:**
The workshop teaches participants how to build a working backend application using the Ash Framework in Elixir. Through hands-on development of the Tuesday project management app, attendees will learn to create resources, set up attributes and relationships, use actions, queries, and changesets, and add real-time updates with PubSub. While the session includes a clear example of connecting Ash to Phoenix, we will focus primarily on Ash’s features without diving into Phoenix LiveView or frontend code, giving maximum time to understand Ash’s core tools and practical data modeling in a project-based setting.

**Workshop prerequisites:**
Prior working knowledge with Phoenix and Ecto.
